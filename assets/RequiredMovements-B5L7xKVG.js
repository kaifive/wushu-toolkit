For example, the athlete loses his center of balance and leans his or her upper body to maintain his balance, either left or right, forward and backwards, or inacircular motion ending upright, it is regarded as a sway.","Shuffle: This refers to a situation when standing or landing on both feet or on a singlefoot or on one foot and one leg. Should any supporting foot move or be displaced laterally it is considered as a shuffle.","Skip: This refers to a situation when standing or landing on both feet or on a single foot. Should any supporting foot leave the carpet in a skip or hop it is considered a skip.","Additional Support: Should an athlete during his/her performance, either when moving or in a set posture, lose balance and make use of a hand, elbow, knee, non- supporting leg (during a single leg posture) or the weapon as an additional support it isconsidered as an additional support. (Note: should the weapon hit the floor during the course of a movement without any force applied to it as additional support it should be considered as a weapon hitting the body or floor and be deducted for accordingly).","Fall: Should an athlete during his/her performance, either when moving or in a set posture, lose balance and make use of both hands, the head, the upper arm (above the elbow), shoulder, torso, buttocks; or should any two or more parts of the body simultaneously make contact with the floor, or one part of the body and the weapon (the weapon is considered an extension of the arm), it is considered as a fall. (Note: In Choreographed Sparring events, intentional falls to the ground are neither considered as nor deducted for as falls).","Weapon-Touching-Body: Should an athlete during a technique with a weapon strike, tap or touch any part of his/her body, it will be considered as weapon-touching-body and be deducted accordingly.","Weapon Deformed: This refers to when the weapon has been deformed to degree in excess of 45° from its original intended shape.","Out-of-bounds: Should an athlete during his/her performance, touch the floor outsideof the boundary line of the competition arena with any part of his/her body, it is considered as out-of-bounds. Should the weapon touch the floor outside of the boundary line of the competition arena; or if any part of the performer’s body is extended beyond the boundary line of the competition arena but does not make contact with the floor it is not considered as out-of-bounds.","Balance Technique Static/Motionless Timing: Calculation of time begins when the movement first stops in a static or motionless state. This applies to Changquan, Jianshu, Daoshu, Qiangshu & Gunshu events only.","Forgetting: Should an athlete during his/her performance have a lapse of memory and be interrupted and pause unconventionally or have chaotic movements, it is considered as forgetting.","Should during a single technique, more than one <other error> occur, they will be deducted in a cumulative manner","Other Errors will be deducted as they occur in a cumulative manner."],F={northern:{title:"Changquan, Jianshu, Daoshu, Qiangshu & Gunshu",standards:["Within a single technique, should there be 1 or more errors, 0.1 will be deducted once.","Within a single group of movements, should there be 2 or more occurrences of the same weapon technique errors, 0.1 will only be deducted once.","For balance techniques held for less than 2 seconds, 0.1 will be deducted once.","No obvious vertical circle formed/No obvious horizontal circle formed refers to the tip of the sword/cudgel/spear tip rotating at an angle of 45° or more off of the vertical/horizontal plane.",...s],codes:[...northernCodes,...otherCodes]},southern:{title:"Nanquan, Nandao & Nangun",standards:["Within a single technique, should there be 1 or more errors, 0.1 will only be deducted once.","Within a single group of movements, should there be 2 or more occurrences of the same weapon technique errors, 0.1 will only be deducted once.","It is permitted to not slap the kicking foot during Téng Kōng Way Bǎi Tuǐ (Jumping Lotus Kick).",...s],codes:[...southernCodes,...otherCodes]},taichi:{title:"Taijiquan & Taijijian",standards:["Within a single technique, should there be 1 or more errors, 0.1 will only be deducted once.","Within a single group of movements, should there be 2 or more occurrences of the same weapon technique errors, 0.1 will only be deducted once.","Within a single group of movements, should there be 2 or more occurrences of the same footwork error, 0.1 will only be deducted once.","Within a single group of movements, should there be 2 or more occurrences of the same stance errors, 0.1 will only be deducted once.
